            <h2>How do proteins get folded?</h2>
            <p>As we learned in Dr. Babu's class, proteins must be folded in
            order to fulfill their intended function. However, protein folding
            is a very complicated process. Proteins get folded almost randomly
            in the cell by bumping into water molecules and other foces until
            they take on their final shape and can be used. This animated
            simulation of a protein folding shows how the folding process
            happens "randomly" over time:</p>

            <h2>How can we simulate folding?</h2>
            <p>Since protein folding occurs in so many randomized intermediate
            steps, simulations must take this into account by modeling many
            possible intermediate shapes between the initial and final state of
            the protein:</p>

              </a>
            </div>
            <p>This video shows how we can use hints from amino acid properties to help constrain our model:</p>

              </a>
            </div>
            <p>With the combined strategies of considering different steps and
            applying constraints, we can make accurate predictions of how a
            protein will fold.</p>

            <h2>What can folding simulations tell us?</h2>
            <p>As "The protein folding revolution" video says, understanding
            protein folding enables us to design new proteins to be used for
            delivering drugs, creating new materials, and more. In addition to
            designing new proteins, we can also get more information about
            protein misfolding and associated diseases, including sickle-cell
            anemia, type II diabetes, and cystic fibrosis.</p>

            <h2>How can we get enough compute power?</h2>
            <p>Running these simulations is very computationally expensive and
            cannot be done efficiently on one computer. However, the problem
            can be split into multiple pieces which can be simulated on
            multiple computers at the same time. However, several powerful
            computers is still not powerful enough to run large scale research
            projects. This is where crowd-sourced solutions come in: you can
            donate cpu power to run folding simulations for research!</p>

            <h3>Folding@home</h3>
            <p><a href="https://foldingathome.org/">Folding@home</a> is a
            distributed computing project for disease research that simulates
            protein folding, computational drug design, and other types of
            molecular dynamics. It is based in Stanford University at the Pande
            Labratory and has been running since October 1, 2000. It relies on
            donated CPU power, and anyone can contribute. Since the beginning,
            they have released papers based on crowdsourced data on
            antibiotics, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, 
            <a href="https://foldingathome.org/project-timeline/">and more</a>.
            Folding@home has a 
            <a href="https://foldingathome.org/start-folding/">desktop app</a> 
            which you can install, and if you're using Google Chrome, you can
            contribute without even installing the app 
            <a href="http://nacl.foldingathome.org/">here</a>.

            <h3>Rosetta@home</h3>
            <a href="http://boinc.bakerlab.org/rosetta/">Rosetta@home</a> is
            a project similar to Folding@home, but is run by the University of
            Washington. Results from Rosetta@home calculations have been used
            to model proteins in herpes simplex virus 1, design possible
            vaccines for HIV, and design proteins to fight against malaria.</p>
